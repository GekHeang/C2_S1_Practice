    <h1> Introduction to html </h1>
    <p> 
        Welcome to the world of code! <br>
        Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Why? <br> 

        <strong> HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. </strong>  It's often the first language learned by developers, marketers and desginers and is core to front-end development work.
        HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website,such as 
        <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">images,</a>
        text, or 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">videos.</a>
        <br> 
    </p>
